Instructions for using the pre-commit hook:

Copy the hook script provided above into a file named pre-commit in the .git/hooks directory of your Git repository. The path to the file should be something like /path/to/your/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit.
bash
Copy code
cp pre-commit /path/to/your/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit
Set the execution permission for the pre-commit file.
bash
Copy code
chmod +x /path/to/your/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit
Enable the gitleaks hook in Git configuration.
bash
Copy code
git config hooks.gitleaks-enable true
Now, whenever you attempt to make a commit, the hook will first check your changes using gitleaks. If gitleaks detects potentially confidential data, it will display an error message, and the commit will be rejected.

If you ever want to disable this hook, you can do so using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git config hooks.gitleaks-enable false
If gitleaks is not installed on your machine, the hook will automatically download and install it in the current directory.

Please note that these instructions assume you have gitleaks installed on your system and that you are working in a Unix-like environment. If you are on Windows or have gitleaks installed in a different location, adjust the paths accordingly.

Remember to customize the gitleaks.toml configuration file to include the specific patterns or rules you want to check for confidential data in your code.
